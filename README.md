# Optimize Workforce Planning using Linear-Programming in Python


We defined a Linear Programming Problem by finding the
the optimal value of a linear function (objective function) of several variables (x[i]), subject to the conditions that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints).

Our problem fits perfectly!

PuLP is a modelling framework for Linear (LP) and Integer Programming (IP) problems written in Python maintained by COIN-OR Foundation (Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research).

Our results are respecting the constraints i.e. the demand is met. However, this sizing is not satisfying as we have 6 extra man days to add in our P&L because of Friday and Saturday.
