# **Optimize Workforce Planning using Linear Programming in Python**

This project focuses on optimizing workforce planning in a warehouse environment using Linear Programming techniques in Python. The goal is to efficiently allocate workers to different shifts while adhering to constraints such as the number of available workers, shift demands, and overtime limits.

The project utilizes the PuLP library for Linear Programming to model and solve the optimization problem. The solution considers real-world constraints, including ensuring sufficient staff coverage for each shift, minimizing overtime, and balancing workloads.

To provide a clear and interactive visualization of workforce planning, the project includes an analysis of workforce demand versus supply, presented through a series of interactive plots. These plots are generated using Plotly and Matplotlib, and they offer insights into the alignment between the scheduled workforce and the required workforce across different shifts.

**Features:**

**Linear Programming Optimization:** Models and solves the workforce allocation problem with constraints on working and off days.

**Visualization:** Interactive dashboards and plots to compare staff demand versus supply, and identify resource gaps or surpluses.

**Scalable Approach:** The model can be extended or modified to accommodate additional constraints or more complex workforce scheduling scenarios.
